# Webpack in Wordpress - Boilerplate

This is a sample project that provide a simple installation of Webpack in a Wordpress theme, adding also some useful tools like Babel, React, Modernizr, js-xss, normalize.css, Autoprefixer, Prettier and a Sass boilerplate.

This **branch** builds separately CSS and main.js, if you want to have two different and separate files just change the branch.


## Setup 

- install Node.js, if you are using cPanel, follow this [guide](https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/cpanel/cpanel-software/create-application-with-nodejs-selector) in order to create a Node app
- copy the repository into a WordPress theme
- build a custom Modernizr file [here](https://modernizr.com/download?setclasses) and replace `/js/modernizr-custom.js`
- open SSH connection
- `cd` in the theme folder, if you are using cPanel enter to the virtual environment (follow the previous guide)
- open `functions.php` and add:
```
/* Enqueue script del bundle di webpack */ 
function webpack_enqueue_scripts() {
	wp_enqueue_script( 'my-script', get_template_directory_uri() . '/dist/main.js', array(), true );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'webpack_enqueue_scripts' );
```
- in the terminal (you can also use `npm run dev` or `npm run watch`:
```
npm install
npm run build
```
- don't forget to follow *To do* section


## To do
- remember to sanitize input client through js-xss (follow the example in `/js/index.js`)
- remember to add conditionals for Modernizr (follow the example in `/js/index.js`)
- remember to lint through Prettier after deploying: `npx prettier --write .`
